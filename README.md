# CSE 536: User-Level Thread Management

User-level multithreading libraries have real-world applications in software development and computer graphics, where parallelism can significantly improve performance. The primary goal of this feature was to enable efficient and lightweight threading, allowing for parallel execution of multiple tasks and reducing the overall response time of the system. The secondary goal was to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for creating and managing threads.
