# CSE 536: Trap and Emulate Virtualization

VMMs have practical applications in cloud computing, where virtualization can improve resource utilization and enable efficient deployment of virtual machines. The primary goal of this feature was to enable the xv6 operating system to run as a virtual machine within our OS, providing a layer of abstraction between the host machine and the virtual machine. The secondary goal was to facilitate testing and development of xv6 in a virtualized environment, allowing for experimentation with different configurations and settings.

## Acknowledgement

We remain thankful to the xv6 team at MIT for their open-source codebase.
